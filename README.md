`mkv-chapter-helper` -  Add/update chapters in an MKV file with the ability to mix timecodes and chapter names from multiple sources 

# Installation
pip:

    pip install mkv-chapter-helper

pipx:

    pipx install mkv-chapter-helper

uv:

    uv tool install mkv-chapter-helper

# Description
mkv-chapter-helper allows you to choose different sources for correct timecodes and correct names for chapters to embed in an MKV file.

**Supported inputs:**
- The input MKV file or another MKV file
- TXT in OGM format or exported from MediaInfo
- XML in Matroska format: https://www.matroska.org/technical/chapters.html
- XML generated by ChapterGrabber
- MediaInfo chapters pasted into the console

If you have a need for other chapter sources, they may be converted by [chapterEditor](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=169984).

## Use Cases

You have ripped your own movie to MKV, so the timecodes are correct, but you did not want to manually write out all chapter names

- There exists a pre-named chapters list on https://chapterdb.plex.tv/ but the timecodes do not line up
- Download the TXT from ChapterDB and specify `--names-from-ogm`

Alternatively:

- You have an MKV with no chapters, but can find them provided in a MediaInfo dump on a torrent tracker.
- You can use `--timecodes-from-mediainfo-paste` and `--names-from-mediainfo-paste` and paste the values in the console interactively.
